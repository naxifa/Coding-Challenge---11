Order Management System - Event Handling in JavaScript

Introduction:
In this challenge, I will create a simple Order Management System for a business that tracks and manages product orders. I will use JavaScript to handle events such as selecting products, updating order quantities, and calculating total prices in real-time. The challenge focuses on event handling and dynamic UI updates in a business context.

Business Case:
Scenario: A small business sells different products online. The business wants to create a system that allows customers to: - Select a product from a dropdown list. - Enter the quantity of the selected product. - Calculate the total price based on the product and quantity. - Display an order summary when the customer places the order.
